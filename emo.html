    <h1>Emotional and Physical Effects</h1>
    <section class="col1">
      <h2>Emotionally</h2>
      <p>
        The occupations that was the most at risk, related to sports, were
        coaches. This obviously emotionally affected all the coaches, feeling
        extremely gloomy as they lost their only source of income. Forget their
        source of income, they can’t even teach their students, which is the
        reason they became coaches in the first place, to teach their students,
        but they can’t even do that since their job is laid off.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="col2">
      <h2>Physically</h2>
      <p>
        In terms of physical health, I believe that athletes and coaches still
        stay relatively fit since they are athletes and coaches. However, when
        it comes to the students, they might not have the motivation to stay
        fit. Even though the gyms might be closed, they can always workout at
        home and definitely use the time they have to workout and get active
        since they don’t have their job.
