          Around $12 billion was lost in revenue and earning, where the loss off
          fitness trainers caused a loss of around $4 billion
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Many jobs were lost as a result to games being cancelled, where around
          1 million sport jobs were lost or laid off - Those jobs include
          attendants, shopkeepers, referees, umpires, coaches, fitness trainers,
          the athletes themselves and etc.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Commercial, Broadcasting and the Revenue during game day are the three
          major income sources but due to the COVID restrictions, it's certain
          that money has been lost in all of those sources
        </li>
        <br />
        Restrictions was placed on stadiums, where people canâ€™t view the games
        in the stadium, so the revenue during gameday is practically gone as an
        income source during 2020
        <br />
        Many games were cancelled, and this obviously meant that channels
        couldn't broadcast any games for months, for example, ESPN had no games
        to stream live and companies like those rely only on sports, so all
        these cancellations obviously made channels lose millions/billions of
        dollars
