    <h2>Short Term</h2>
<br>
  <section>
     <ul>
      <li> When it comes to short term, the decrease of people showing up in the stadiums definitely is an effect of COVID, however, COVID will eventually die down, with more vaccine getting produced, many viewers will take those vaccines and stadiums will once again be full
      </li>
      <br> 
      <li> A lot of pro teams always train to become better and stronger, and they mostly do this by going to training camp to work on their skills together, however, COVID has restricted this. Transportation in itself as been extremely limited and restricted, and training camp is where there are various people together, however, training in a group during COVID was seen as too risky, so various training camps had to be cancelled for safety reasons. Though that might have been the case last year, it can be presumed that training camps will open up this year.

  <h2> Long Term</h2>
<br>
    <section>
      <ul> 
        <li> Colleges and universities definitely lost big time when COVID hit, and it definitely hit them hard when it came to revenues. Many leagues had to cancel their game seasons. Many programs that play in college sports had to be cut out to save money due to the revenue loss. Where those programs can’t be brought back, until those colleges/university gets enough money back to open up those programs again, which will definitely take a while.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> Many stadiums had to also change to fit with the COVID restrictions and regulations, so these stadiums had to physically change. There are white elephants, basically stuff at the stadiums that are costly but isn’t really needed, such as some sports facilities which aren’t used much and is too costly. Though these white elephants contribute to the “looks” of the stadium, they are ultimately not needed, and with the pandemic heavily affecting the economy, stadiums have to find ways to cut costs, even if it will alter the stadiums permanently
